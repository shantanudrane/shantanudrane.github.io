This research is concerned with inferring knowledge from data in such a way that 
the data, or the algorithm, or the inference have to be protected from adversaries. 
The approaches followed depend upon the kinds of security and privacy guarantees 
desired and the strength of the adversary. We employ computationally secure 
primitives, such as homomorphic encryption, for manipulating data in the 
encrypted domain. We also investigate unconditionally secure approaches such as 
secret sharing, and statistically private mechanisms based on differential 
privacy.
